# =========
# Append the path of the algorithm to the sys.path
#
# This is needed because THIS .py file is downloaded from the given URL, whilst the rest of the implementation is not.
# The rest of the implementation, can (and should) be added in two ways:
# 1. ADD/COPY the implementation source code in the Dockerfile provided later to the dataspace.
# 2. Mounted as a volume for quick development iterations.
#
# This step is not needed if this file contains the whole implementation of your algorithm, in which case
# you could use the `python-monolith` version.
